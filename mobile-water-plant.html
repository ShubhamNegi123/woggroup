                        <p>Mobile water treatment plants offer quick, reliable and cost effective service to meet the problem of water crisis. Mobile water facility is installed on a mobile trailer with all the water treatment equipments. The trailer can reach the site within no time and can provide safe drinking water to the population. </p>
                        <p>Mobile water treatment systems can treat both the surface and the ground water. When these units are applied for groundwater treatment a lot of money is saved, because of the opportunity to perform the treatment on the spot, so that there is no need for transportation. Moreover, even very small particles can be removed from the water during treatment in a mobile unit.</p>

                        <p>Mobile treatment plant consists of either one or more than one container. Depending on the nature of the water to be treated the number of containers vary. Water can be purified following both the steps that is primary treatment and the secondary treatment. The steps that are followed in both of these treatments are: Sedimentation, Sand filtration, Membrane filtration (Reverse Osmosis) and ion exchange. The treatment units are generally placed near the source of the water pollution. If the processing is carried out in batch then constant separation and processing will prevent the water from becoming polluted again.</p>
