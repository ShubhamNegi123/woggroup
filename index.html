                        <p>WOG Group provides a Drinking Water Management Plant since ensuring a safe drinking water
                            supply without innovative technology is challenging. Innovative ways for purifying drinking
                            water and reusing water are gaining hold in a variety of locales across the world. Water
                            treatment to make it potable is a multi-step process that employs chemical, physical, and
                            biological methods. Coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection

                            The sewage treatment system uses only a negligible amount of chemicals in its biological and
                            natural treatment process. We have established ourselves in several industries, earning our
                            client's trust by meeting their needs. Our sewage treatment systems are reliable and
                            cost-effective. We should commend WOG Group for its environmental innovations, which include
                            effective water purifying technology. At the Domestic Sewage Water Treatment Plant, water is
                            recycled to remove dangerous pollutants and prepare it for reuse. On staff, we have sewage
                            treatment professionals who can provide trusted solutions. Biological and physicochemical
                            processes are examples of our tried-and-true methods. WOG Group has expanded its line of
                            domestic sewage water filtering products. As sewage produced by residential areas contains
                            components that need to be treated, domestic sewage treatment plants are essential for
                            wastewater analysis and optimization.

                            during the wastewater treatment process. Effluent Water Treatment is critical in several
                            industries. It eliminates all hazardous substances from the water and uses various processes

                            1. WOG Group is working on a research project that will allow our staff to produce zero
                            liquid waste. The wastewater treatment plant collects suspended particles, destroys organic
                            molecules, and disposes of sludge. It is essential to identify that humans may have
                            difficulty disposing of sewage. Wastewater treatment plants are becoming important in
                            industrial wastewater and sewage research.

                            substances, sewage treatment plants are critical in the research of industrial wastewater.
                            At a sewage treatment facility, we will recycle water by removing hazardous substances and
                            preparing it for reuse.

                            We have experts on hand to provide dependable water purifying solutions. WOG is a group of
                            researchers and specialists working together to develop a wastewater treatment plant that is
                            both efficient and effective. Water treatment is necessary for a variety of industries.
                            Before recycling, reusing or disposing of industrial effluent, this is a simple technique
                            for removing contaminants. Our professionals have the knowledge and experience required to

                            <br>
                            ETP are water treatment plants that recycle wastewater effluent which is produced as a
                            by-product in industries. The purpose of releasing clean water into the environment is to
                            ensure that chemical pollutants do not affect the environment. Various toxic or
                            non-biodegradable effluents are present depending on the industry. We can find organic
                            contaminants in the food and beverage industries. Because industrial wastewater contains a
                            diverse range of contaminants, a treatment method for them is required.

                            Wastewater treatment, often known as sewage treatment, is a procedure that purifies water by
                            eliminating some or all impurities, allowing it to be discharged back into the environment.
                            Untreated wastewater contains significant levels of organic material, pathogenic microbes,
                            nutrients, and toxic substances that can be hazardous to human health, the environment, and
                            waterways. Effective wastewater treatment is therefore critical. The primary goal of
                            wastewater treatment plants is to generate water that we can reuse in a more environmentally
                            friendly and healthy manner. Treatment of wastewater is a critical component in water
                            pollution prevention.

                            WOG Group has developed low-cost, compact mobile water purifying technology that can be used
                            anywhere. We use the most modern and innovative ways to treat both underground and surface
                            water. Mobile water treatment units are the greatest solution when a community's existing
                            water purification plant breaks down. Water purification systems are simple to set up,
                            requiring only water, electricity, and outlets. To disinfect the water, chemical methods
                            such as precipitation, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange will be used. When utilized for
                            groundwater treatment, these units save a lot of money because they can complete the
                            treatment on the spot, eliminating the need for transportation.

                            Wastewater treatment is a technique that improves water quality by removing all impurities,
                            allowing them to be reused or discharged back into the environment. They roughly categorized
                            wastewater treatment methods into three types, which are:
                            <br>• Physical treatment is the process of removing pollutants/contaminants on a physical
                            basis.
                            <br>• Chemical treatment is removing impurities or harmful wastes through chemical
                            reactions.
                            <br>• Biological treatment is the process of removal of contaminants through biological
                            processes

                            A treatment facility is required to treat wastewater in an industrial process. It lowers
                            industrial water consumption and pollution to the environment. If processed in a treatment
                            plant, a significant amount of industrial on-site effluent may be reused. There are several
                            types of treatment plants.

                            A water treatment plant is a system that is used to remove polluted elements from water.
                            These materials can be solids, liquids, or semi-solids. Many industries rely on water as
                            their primary source of water. We will dispose of water into adjacent water bodies at the
                            end of the operation, affecting the environment. Wastewater that is treated will allow it to
                            be reused.

                            Effluent Treatment Plants are important in eliminating all harmful chemicals from the water
                            as this water will be disposed of in the environment. Recycling of wastewater is necessary
                            for every industry as per government rules of disposal of wastewater from the industries. It
                            now becomes mandatory for industries to set up ETP. After ETP wastewater become reusable,
                            and can be used for various purposes.
